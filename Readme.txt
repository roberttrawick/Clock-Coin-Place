clockCoinPlace solves the following problem:
   Given 12 coins - 4 pennies, 4 nickels, and 4 dimes,
   find all the sequences in which they may be placed on
   the 12 hours of the clock face so that they occupy every
   hour and are not placed on top of one another. A coin
   must be spaced from the last coin a distance in hours
   equal to the number of hours in its denomination. For
   example, if a penny (1 cent) is placed at hour 1, if the
   next coin is a nickel (5 cents) it must be placed at 6
   (1+5). If the next coin after the penny at 1 is a dime
   (10 cents), it would be placed at 11 (1+10).
   Coins of the same denomination are indistinguishable.
   That is, sequences are unique only by the sequence of
   denomination.
   Any position may be the starting point.
